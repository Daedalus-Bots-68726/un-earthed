hello guys so basically to use github you will do the following
run the following commands in terminal:
git --version
if you see a version then you are good, if not then search up how to get git
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "the email you used in github" (only do if you do not have ssh keys)
spam the enter button
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (copy the key)
then go to github and open settings and find ssh keys, add the key
ssh -T git@github.com (this is a test, if it works then you will see a confirmation)
git clone git@github.com:Daedalus-Bots-68726/un-earthed.git
cd un-earthed
now github should be setup
how to upload your code:
git add file (replace file with the file you want to upload to the repo, replace file with . to upload all files)
git commit -m "random stuff" (the message is not required, just dont put -m if you dont want it)
git push (if there is an error read it, and try to fix it or put it in google)
